# Move It

is a mobile application developed for Android with React Native Expo.
I am currently developing this solo with no particular due date.

## Todos

- [ ] Flexible ExerciseData
  - [x] Extend drizzle orm
  - [ ] Rework default data
  - [ ] Make the inputs work with the new concept

- [ ] Split Edits, History and Graph, and Configuration for a given Task into multiple Tabs; with a selector at the bottom of the screen

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

To work with this project you will need either a [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/) or a [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/).  
Working with your local device is the better experience in my opinion (especially on linux).
